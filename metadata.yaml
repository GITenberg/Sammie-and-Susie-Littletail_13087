description: Once upon a time there lived in a small house built underneath the ground
  two curious little folk, with their father, their mother, their uncle and Jane Fuzzy-Wuzzy.
  Jane Fuzzy-Wuzzy was the nurse, hired girl and cook, all in one, and the reason
  she had such a funny name was because she was a funny cook. She had long hair, a
  sharp nose, a very long tail and the brightest eyes you ever saw. She could stay
  under water a long time, and was a fine swimmer.
